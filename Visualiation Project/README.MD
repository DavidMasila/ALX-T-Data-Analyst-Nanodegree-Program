# Ford GoBike System Data Exploration and Visualization

## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
The data set has data of 174,952 riders characterized by Age_group, Age, duration of ride, bike_id, start_data, start_hour, end_hour, bike_ID and other features. 

## Summary of Findings

- During exploration i found out that majority of the bikers were subcribers.
- Further comparison between subcribers and customers showed that customers rode for longer durations compared to subscribers across all ages. - In regards to gender, majority of the riders were male outnumbering the other genders by a very large margin. 
- I further discovered most rides were taken during weekdays and thursday was the day with the leading number of rides. I expected the weekends to have majority of the rides. 
- The rides peaked at 8am and 5pm. 
- After binning the age column, it also came to my attention that people in their thirties rode more compared to all other age groups. They even rode more compared to the younger people in their twenties. 

## key insights for presentation

For the presentation my focus was on:

- Periods when most rides are taken. This was shown by a bar graph having two peaks at 8am an 5pm
- Number of bicycle rides per day of week. This was plotted on a bar graph comparing days vs number of rides.
- Distribution of rider number by their respective gender. This was plotted on a bar graph showing Gender vs number of riders.
- Influence of age group and day of week on number of riders. This was plotted on a compound bar plot.
- Lastly my focus was on how age and user type influenced duration of rides.
